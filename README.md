GitHub [statisticalmice/julia-jupyter-docker](https://github.com/StatisticalMice/julia-jupyter-docker)

## Images

### Julia 1.5

`statisticalmice/julia-jupyter:1.5-buster`  
`statisticalmice/julia-jupyter:latest`

### Julia 1.6

`statisticalmice/julia-jupyter:1.6-buster`

### Layers

1. The original Julia images are built on debian:buster-slim
2. These images are built on julia:1.5-buster or julia:1.6-buster
3. Create user 'arthur'
4. Install Mambaforge
5. Install jupyterlab and jupyter-server-proxy from conda-forge
6. Install IJulia and Pluto
7. Install glances, which is a server monitoring tool with a web interface

## Using

### Running Containers Locally

Example invocation:  
docker run -ti --rm -p 8888:8888 statisticalmice/julia-jupyter:1.6-buster

Attaching a host volume to the container:
-v /host/path/to/workspace:/home/arthur/workspace

Setting the Jupyter authentication token:  
-e JUPYTER_TOKEN=my-secret-password

If you want to start a bash shell inside the container instead of Jupyter, add 'bash' without quotes to the command line.

### Jupyter

1.5 and 1.6 start Jupyter automatically. Python and Julia kernels are available in Jupyter. Pluto and glances are available and are proxied by Jupyter.

Setting JUPYTER_TOKEN environment variable sets the token for Jupyter Lab, this is standard functionality. This is mostly needed if you run the container in a cloud.

From the command line you can run:

jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 

julia -e "using Pluto; Pluto.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8888, launch_browser=false, require_secret_for_open_links=false, require_secret_for_access=false)"

## Jupyter Docker Stacks

You can find the Docker images built by the Jupyter project using the following link. The `jupyter/datascience-notebook` contains Julia.

These
* have more features
* are much larger
* are based on Ubuntu
